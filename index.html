                      the combatant of the Straw Hat Pirates, and one of their

                      doing so in the Romance Dawn Arc.[3] As a master of Three

                      his childhood training in Shimotsuki Village, Zoro is
                      among the three most powerful combatants of the Straw

                      become the greatest swordsman in the world, in order to
                      honor a promise he made to his deceased childhood friend

                      once.[15] Brook eventually learned to tap deeper into the
                      powers of his Devil Fruit, giving him significant control
                      over his own soul and the souls of others. His dream is to
                      reunite with his old friend, Laboon, at Reverse Mountain,
                      where he resides with Crocus.[18]

                      "Knight of the Sea" Jinbe[1] is the helmsman of the Straw
                      Hat Pirates. He is the tenth member of the crew and the
                      ninth to join, doing so during the Wano Country Arc.[18]
                      Jinbe is a whale shark fish-man and a powerful master of
                      Fish-Man Karate. His dream is to fulfill his former
                      captain Fisher Tiger's dying wish of coexistence and
                      equality between humans and fish-men. He was a member of
                      the Sun Pirates, eventually becoming its second captain
                      after the death of their original captain, Tiger.[8] He
                      eventually became one of the Seven Warlords of the Sea,
                      though he resigned during the Summit War of
                      Marineford.[4][8]
